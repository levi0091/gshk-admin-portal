"""The baked text layer that makes the generated NAR1 render identically
everywhere.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The values used to be AcroForm field values and nothing else.
Every one of them carried an appearance stream pointing at `/PMingLiU` -- a
Traditional Chinese face the template does not embed -- under
`NeedAppearances=true`, which tells conforming viewers to throw those streams
away and regenerate from `/DA`. Acrobat and Outlook obey; Chrome's pdfium
largely renders the existing stream. Same bytes, two documents, which is
exactly what the client reported.

So the values are drawn as a real page layer in fonts we embed, the widgets
are hidden so nothing paints over it, and NeedAppearances is cleared. `/V` is
still written -- the data stays machine-readable and the existing suite still
asserts on it -- but no viewer is asked to interpret it any more.
